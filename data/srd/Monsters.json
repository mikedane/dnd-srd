It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: \n\nAt will: detect magic\n3/day: enlarge/reduce, tongues\n1/day each: conjure elemental (fire elemental only), gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift, wall of fire\n\n**Variant: Genie Powers**: Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.\n\nDisguises.\nSome genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\nWishes.\nThe genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect.

It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: <br><br>At will: detect magic<br>3/day: enlarge/reduce, tongues<br>1/day each: conjure elemental (fire elemental only), gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift, wall of fire<br><br><strong>Variant: Genie Powers</strong>: Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.<br><br>Disguises.<br>Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.<br>Wishes.<br>The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.<br>To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording.

The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.\nSoul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).\n\n**Hag Coven**: When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\n\n**Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)**: While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves: \n\n• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\n• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\n• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\n• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\n• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\n• 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\n\n**Hag Eye (Coven Only)**: A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\n\n Actions\n\n**Claws (Hag Form Only)**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.\n\n**Change Shape**: The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.\n\n**Etherealness**: The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.\n\n**Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)**: While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.\n\n  ","htmlcontent":"<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>: The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks).

A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).<br><br><strong>Hag Coven</strong>: When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.<br>A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.<br><br><strong>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)</strong>: While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves: <br><br>• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness<br>• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object<br>• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt<br>• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph<br>• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying<br>• 6th level (1 slot): eye bite<br><br>For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.<br><br><strong>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</strong>: A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.<br>A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Claws (Hag Form Only)</strong>: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Change Shape</strong>: The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.<br><br><strong>Etherealness</strong>: The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.<br><br><strong>Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)</strong>: While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.<br><br>","data":{"AC":"17 (Natural Armor)","HP":"112 (15d8+45)","CHA":"16","CON":"16","DEX":"15","INT":"16","STR":"18","WIS":"14","Size":"Medium","Type":"fiend","Speed":"30 ft.","Roll 0":"Claws\n1d20 + 7\n2d8+4","Senses":"Darkvision 120 Ft.","Skills":"Deception +7, Insight +6, Perception +6, Stealth +6","Source":"SRD 5.0","data-XP":"1,800","Category":"Monsters","Alignment":"Neutral Evil","Languages":"Abyssal, Common, Infernal, Primordial","Spell Book":"Detect Magic, Magic Missile, Plane Shift, Ray Of Enfeeblement, Sleep, Identify, Ray Of Sickness, Hold Person, Locate Object, Bestow Curse, Counterspell, Lightning Bolt, Phantasmal Killer, Polymorph, Contact Other Plane, Scrying, Eyebite","Resistances":"Cold, Fire; Bludgeoning, Piercing, And Slashing From Nonmagical Weapons That Aren't Silvered","data-CHA-mod":"+3","data-CON-mod":"+3","data-DEX-mod":"+2","data-INT-mod":"+3","data-STR-mod":"+4","data-SizeNum":"4","data-WIS-mod":"+2","Challenge Rating":"5","Passive Perception":"16","Condition Immunities":"Charmed"}},{"name":"Adult Black Dragon","content":" Traits\n\n**Amphibious**: The dragon can breathe air and water.\n\n**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**: If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\n\n Actions\n\n**Multiattack**: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence.

On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.\nUnless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.\n\n**Hag Coven**: When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\n\n**Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)**: While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves: \n\n• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\n• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\n• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\n• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\n• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\n• 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\n\n**Hag Eye (Coven Only)**: A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\n\n Actions\n\n**Claws**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.\n\n**Death Glare**: The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 ft. of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.\n\n**Illusory Appearance**: The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.\n\n  ","htmlcontent":"<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Amphibious</strong>: The hag can breathe air and water.<br><br><strong>Horrific Appearance</strong>: Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.<br>Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.<br><br><strong>Hag Coven</strong>: When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.<br>A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.<br><br><strong>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)</strong>: While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves: <br><br>• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness<br>• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object<br>• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt<br>• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph<br>• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying<br>• 6th level (1 slot): eye bite<br><br>For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.<br><br><strong>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</strong>: A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.<br>A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Claws</strong>: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Death Glare</strong>: The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 ft. of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.<br><br><strong>Illusory Appearance</strong>: The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.<br>The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws.

She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: \n\nAt will: dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery\n\n**Mimicry**: The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.\n\n**Hag Coven**: When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\n\n**Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)**: While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves: \n\n• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\n• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\n• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\n• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\n• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\n• 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\n\n**Hag Eye (Coven Only)**: A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\n\n Actions\n\n**Claws**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.\n\n**Illusory Appearance**: The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.\n\n**Invisible Passage**: The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.\n\n  ","htmlcontent":"<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Amphibious</strong>: The hag can breathe air and water.<br><br><strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>: The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12).

If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.<br><br><strong>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)</strong>: While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves: <br><br>• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness<br>• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object<br>• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt<br>• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph<br>• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying<br>• 6th level (1 slot): eye bite<br><br>For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.<br><br><strong>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</strong>: A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.<br>A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Claws</strong>: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Illusory Appearance</strong>: The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.<br>The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.<br><br><strong>Invisible Passage</strong>: The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.<br><br>","data":{"AC":"17 (Natural Armor)","HP":"82 (11d8+33)","CHA":"14","CON":"16","DEX":"12","INT":"13","STR":"18","WIS":"14","Size":"Medium","Type":"fey","Speed":"30 ft.","Roll 0":"Claws\n1d20 + 6\n2d8+4","Senses":"Darkvision 60 Ft.","Skills":"Arcana +3, Deception +4, Perception +4, Stealth +3","Source":"SRD 5.0","data-XP":"700","Category":"Monsters","Alignment":"Neutral Evil","Languages":"Common, Draconic, Sylvan","Spell Book":"Dancing Lights, Minor Illusion, Vicious Mockery, Identify, Ray Of Sickness, Hold Person, Locate Object, Bestow Curse, Counterspell, Lightning Bolt, Phantasmal Killer, Polymorph, Contact Other Plane, Scrying, Eyebite","data-CHA-mod":"+2","data-CON-mod":"+3","data-DEX-mod":"+1","data-INT-mod":"+1","data-STR-mod":"+4","data-SizeNum":"4","data-WIS-mod":"+2","Challenge Rating":"3","Passive Perception":"14"}},{"name":"Kobold","content":" Traits\n\n**Sunlight Sensitivity**: While in sunlight, the kobold has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\n\n**Pack Tactics**: The kobold has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the kobold's allies is within 5 ft. of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.\n\n Actions\n\n**Dagger**: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
