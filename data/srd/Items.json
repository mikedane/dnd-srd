A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.\n\nStar: Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.\n\nSun: You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the DM determines randomly) appears in your hands.\n\nTalons: Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.\n\nThrone: You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill.

If you didn't target a creature, you become the target and must make the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instantly petrified. On any other failed save, the target is restrained and begins to turn to stone.
